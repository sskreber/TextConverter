# TextConverter
The script allows you to specify a text and then returns its encoded version (by shifting each character to the right in the alphabet based on the number of occurrences of the 1st letter of this word). CODED in IntelliJ.

Fixed issues compared to FunExercises Exercise 2: (1) shifting occurs based on letter's number of occurrences, not its position in the alphabet; (2) fixed an eternal while loop at the creation of shiftByThisNumber; (3) introduced resetting of alphabetItemNumber at the creation of changedText when checking moves onto next letter of word.
